<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<p align="left">
A recommendation system is a type of information filtering system which attempts to predict the 
preferences of a user, and make suggests based on these preferences. There are a wide variety of 
applications for recommendation systems. These have become increasingly popular over the last few 
years and are now utilized in most online platforms that we use. The content of such platforms varies 
from movies, music, books and videos, to friends and stories on social media platforms, to products on 
e-commerce websites, to people on professional and dating websites, to search results returned on 
Google. Often, these systems are able to collect information about a users choices, and can use this 
information to improve their suggestions in the future. In the browser, if we search movie name it will 
give similar movies related to that input movie. This is done by three recommendation engine such as 
popular based recommendation engine, content-based recommendation engine, collaborative filtering based recommendation engine.</p>
<p align="left">
The popular based recommendation engine is nothing but trending list on YouTube, Netflix, etc. They 
will keep on tracking the video views and update the on-trending list. The content-based 
recommendation engine is taking the input from the user and give a similar rank list based on the 
content related to the input movie. In this project, the content-based recommendation engine is used. 
The collaborative filtering-based recommendation engine is first search the similar user based on their 
activity and behavior and if the first user and second user have seen the same movie and if the first 
user has seen the new movie but if the second user not. It recommends new movies to a second user and 
vice-versa</p>
